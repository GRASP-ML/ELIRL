# ELIRL
2018 Project on Lifelong Learning from Demonstration

This repository contains the code used to generate results for the NeurIPS-18 paper Lifelong Inverse Reinforcement Learning [1]. 

The main algorithm implementation is in the ELIRL directory, while support for cross-domain transfer is in the ELIRL_CrossDomain directory.

The results from the paper can be replicated by running the relevant files from the ELIRL_testing directory.

If you use this code, please cite [1].
